Computer Evolution View (A) allows the assessment for all quantum computers based on a temporal analysis for multiple performance metrics. Circuit Filtering View (B) supports the filtering for the potential optimal compiled circuits. Circuit Comparison View (C) supports the in-depth comparison regarding the performance of qubits or quantum gates and corresponding usages. Fidelity Comparison view (D) shows the fidelity distribution of the execution result. Probability Distribution view (F) visualizes the results of state distribution for users in quantum computing.</p>

                            <h2>Description</h2>
                            <p style="text-align:justify">Quantum computing has submitted considerable public attention due to its exponential speedup over classical computing. Despite its advantages, today's quantum computers intrinsically suffer from noise and are error-prone. To guarantee the high fidelity of the execution result of a quantum algorithm, it is crucial to inform users of the noises of the used quantum computer and the compiled physical circuits. However, an intuitive and systematic way to make users aware of the quantum computing noise is still missing. In this paper, we fill the gap by proposing a novel visualization approach to achieve noise-aware quantum computing. It provides a holistic picture of the noise of quantum computing through multiple interactively coordinated views: a computer evolution view with a circuit-like design overviews the temporal evolution of the noises of different quantum computers, a compiled circuit filtering view facilitates quick filtering of multiple compiled physical circuits for the same quantum algorithm, and a circuit comparison view with a coupled bar chart enable detailed comparison of the filtered compiled circuits. We extensively evaluate the performance of VACSEN through two case studies on quantum algorithms of different scales and in-depth interviews with 12 quantum computing users. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of VACSEN in achieving noise-aware quantum computing.</p>
